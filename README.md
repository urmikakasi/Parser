# Parser
A PDF and image parser which can extract and convert data into text or excel files.

This parser is meant for extracting and parsing bank statements. They are tokenized and hence formatted into a text file which can be used for further analysis. To parse a statement, load a pdf into this folder, accordingly change the filename and un-comment the bank statement segment of the code.

For demonstration purposes, a receipt has been uploaded in both JPG and PDF formats.
